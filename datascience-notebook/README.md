## Basic Use

The following command starts a container with the Notebook server listening for HTTP connections on port 8888 without authentication configured.

```
docker run -d -p 8888:8888 3blades/datascience-notebook
```

## Conda Environments

The default Python 3.x [Conda environment](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html) resides in `/opt/conda`. A second Python 2.x Conda environment exists in `/opt/conda/envs/python2`. You can [switch to the python2 environment](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html#change-environments-activate-deactivate) in a shell by entering the following:

```
source activate python2
```

You can return to the default environment with this command:

```
source deactivate
```

The commands `ipython`, `python`, `pip`, `easy_install`, and `conda` (among others) are available in both environments.
